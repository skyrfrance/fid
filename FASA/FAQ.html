    <h2>Welcome to our FAQ page!</h2>
    <p>Have a Question about who we are or what we do? Look through here and we may be able to give you an answer! If you do not see a question on this list that was on your mind, please visit our contact page where we have the email addresses of site admins that will help!</p>

    <h2>What is your main goal?</h2>
    <p>Our main goal is to keep artists inspired to create. Financial troubles and the stress of not having a bigger audience can get in the way, so our group supplies both of those things to local artists. We directly donate, advertise local exhibits, and give out supplies to those in need. In our community, we make sure there is no such thing as a "starving artist"!</p>

    <h2>Is joining the community free?</h2>
    <p>Yes! All you need to do to join is submit a form with your information and genuine examples of your work! Our team will be sure to look you over to make sure you are legit, and you will be elligible to our financial support and advertising.</p>

    <h2>Is there a space for artists to collaborate?</h2>
    <p>Of course there is! Our gallery doubles as a forum where different artists can view each others work and eventually message each other if they wish to do so. </p>

    <h2>Is there a penalty for plaigerism?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely there is. In this group we hold a no-tolerence policy towards the matter and using another artist's work to pass it off as your own will result in a permanent ban.</p>
